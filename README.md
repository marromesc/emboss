# Protein Analyzer

This is a very simple script to create a batch file to analyze multiple peptide sequences parallely with EMBOSS. 

Just save your .FASTA files in a folder named fastaseq and execute the script with perl:

perl protein_analyzer.pl

In the documentation it is attached a .bat example file to analyze the protein PDL-1.
